        "### **1. Focus on Retaining High-Value Customers (Cluster 3)**\n",
        "- **Offer Exclusive Loyalty Programs**: Provide tailored loyalty benefits, early access to products, and exclusive discounts to maintain engagement and drive repeat purchases.\n",
        "- **Upsell and Cross-Sell**: Introduce premium products or bundles targeting their high spending patterns across product categories like wines, gold products, and meats.\n",

        "- **Incentivize Higher Engagement**: Offer targeted discounts or special offers to encourage increased spending and purchases across channels.\n",
        "- **Educate About Products**: Provide content (emails, guides, or social media) showcasing the value and uniqueness of products they don’t purchase frequently.\n",
        "- **Improve Campaign Effectiveness**: Refine campaign messaging based on their moderate response rate to increase acceptance.\n",

        "### **3. Reengage Low-Value Customers (Cluster 1)**\n",

        "- **Understand Barriers to Engagement**: Conduct surveys or collect feedback to identify reasons for their low purchases and disengagement.\n",
        "- **Promote Entry-Level Products**: Introduce affordable or trial-sized products to ease them into higher spending.\n",

        "- **Digital Campaigns for All Clusters**: Focus on targeted digital campaigns, particularly for Clusters 0 and 2, as they have moderate to high online engagement.\n",
